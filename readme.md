## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

| Tool           | Purpose                             |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| PostgreSQL     | Backend relational database         |
| pgAdmin 4      | SQL execution & schema inspection   |
| Python (pandas)| Cleaning raw data and automation    |
| Jupyter        | EDA and automation notebooks        |
| SQL            | Core logic to extract insights      |

---

## 🧼 Step 1: Data Cleaning (`1_data_cleaning.ipynb`)

- Loaded all raw `.csv` files from `data/datasets/`
- Standardized column names (underscores)
- Filled missing values with `"NA"`
- Fixed bad dates (e.g., `16-12-2019`) and numeric errors (`#NUM!`)
- Saved cleaned files to `data/outputs/`

---

## 📊 Step 2: Exploratory Analysis (`2_eda_analysis.ipynb`)

- Null value summary
- Unique count checks for ID columns
- Gender, state, and payer distribution plots
- Verified foreign key relations across tables

---

## 🗃️ Step 3: PostgreSQL Database Setup

- **File:** `database/Defining_Tables.sql`  
  Created tables with constraints and relations between fact and dimension tables.

- **File:** `database/Load_Data_Scripts.py`  
  Loaded cleaned `.csv` files into PostgreSQL using `psycopg2` with status logging.

---

## 🧠 Step 4: Business Problem KPIs

20 real-time healthcare business KPIs have been solved using SQL and stored inside:

- `business_problems_outcomes/` → SQL query files  
- `business_problems_outcomes/csvs/` → Results via **pgAdmin**
- `outputs/csvs/` → Results via **Python notebook**

Each KPI includes:
- Clear objective
- SQL logic
- Output CSV from both sources

## 🧪 Step 5: Run SQL Queries with Python

Notebook: [`3_sql_query_runner.ipynb`](notebooks/3_sql_query_runner.ipynb)

- Reads all `.sql` files in `business_problems_outcomes/`
- Connects to PostgreSQL database
- Executes each query dynamically
- Saves output result as `.csv` into `outputs/csvs/`

---

## 🔗 Entity Relationship Diagram

- **Fact table**: `facttable`
- **Linked dimensions**: `dimpatient`, `dimpayer`, `dimphysician`, `dimdate`, etc.
- Built using [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io) or **pgAdmin** > *ERD Tool*

![ERD Diagram](diagrams/ERD_Healthcare.png)

## 📬 Summary

This project demonstrates **end-to-end healthcare analytics** using:

- ✅ PostgreSQL schema with relationships and indexing
- ✅ SQL queries solving real-world business KPIs
- ✅ Python (`psycopg2`, `pandas`) for query automation
- ✅ Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning and exploration
- ✅ Full insight generation across cost, coverage, efficiency, and delays

---

## 🚀 Run It Yourself

1. **Load Data to PostgreSQL**  
   Run: `python database/Load_Data_Scripts.py`

2. **Run KPIs**  
   Use either:
   - SQL in **pgAdmin** (manually)
   - Notebook: [`3_sql_query_runner.ipynb`](notebooks/3_sql_query_runner.ipynb)

3. **Check Results**  
   Output `.csv` files are saved in:
   - `business_problems_outcomes/csvs/` → via **pgAdmin**
   - `outputs/csvs/` → via **Python script**
